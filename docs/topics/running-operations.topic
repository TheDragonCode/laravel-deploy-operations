            To run all of your outstanding operations, execute the <code>%command_run%</code> artisan command:
        </p>

        <code-block lang="bash">
            %artisan% %command_run%
        </code-block>

        <p>
            The order in which operations are called is checked by file name in alphabetical order, without taking into account directory names:

    <chapter title="Isolating Operations Execution" id="isolating_operations_execution">
        <p>
            If you are deploying your application across multiple servers and running operations as part of your deployment process,
            you likely do not want two servers attempting to run the database at the same time.
            To avoid this, you may use the <code>isolated</code> option when invoking the
            <code>%command_run%</code> command.
        </p>

        <code-block lang="bash">
            %artisan% %command_run% --isolated
        </code-block>
    </chapter>

    <chapter title="Split Launch Option" id="split_launch_option">
        <p>
            Sometimes it becomes necessary to launch operations separately, for example, to notify about the successful deployment of a project.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is a <code>before</code> option for this when calling operations:
        </p>

        <code-block lang="bash">
            %artisan% %command_run% --before
        </code-block>

        <p>
            When you call the <code>%command_run%</code> command with the <code>before</code> parameter,
            the script will only perform operations for which the <code>needBefore</code> method is <code>true</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            For backwards compatibility, the <code>needBefore</code> method returns <code>true</code> by default,
            but operations will only be executed if the option is explicitly passed.
        </p>

        <code-block lang="php" src="need_before.php" include-lines="5-" />

        <p>
            For example, you need to call operations when deploying an application. Some operations should be run after the operations are deployed, and others after the application is fully launched.
        </p>

        <p>
            To run, you need to pass the <code>before</code> parameter.
            For example, when using
            <a href="https://github.com/deployphp/deployer">Deployer</a> it would look like this:
        </p>

        <code-block lang="php" src="deployer.php" include-lines="5-" />

        <p>
            Thus, when <code>%command_run%</code> is called, all operations whose
            <code>before</code> parameter is <code>true</code> will be executed,
            and after that, the remaining tasks will be executed.
        </p>

        <note>
            If you call the <code>%command_run%</code> command without the <code>before</code> parameter,
            then all tasks will be executed regardless of the value of the
            <code>needBefore</code> method inside the operation class.
        </note>
    </chapter>

    <chapter title="Forcing Operations To Run In Production" id="forcing_operations_to_run_in_production">
        <tip>
            Some commands cannot be executed in production without confirmation.
            These include all commands except <code>%command_status%</code> and <code>%command_run%</code>.
        </tip>

        <p>
            Some operations are destructive, which means they may cause you to lose data.
            In order to protect you from running these commands against your production database,
            you will be prompted for confirmation before the commands are executed.
            To force the commands to run without a prompt, use the <code>--force</code> flag:
        </p>

        <code-block lang="bash">
            %artisan% %command_install% --force
        </code-block>
    </chapter>

    <chapter title="Execution Every Time" id="execution_every_time">
        <p>
            In some cases, you need to call the code every time you deploy the application. For example, to call reindexing.
        </p>

        <p>
            To do this, override the <code>shouldOnce</code> method in the operation file:
        </p>

        <code-block lang="php" src="once_method.php" include-lines="5-" />

        <p>
            If the value is <code>shouldOnce</code> is <code>false</code>,
            the up method will be called every time the <code>%command_run%</code> command called.
        </p>

        <p>
            In this case, information about it will not be written to the
            <code>%table%</code> table and, therefore, the
            <code>down</code> method will not be called when the rollback command is called.
        </p>

        <note>
            When using the <code>before</code> parameter to run command,
            it is recommended to override the value of the <code>needBefore</code> method to <code>false</code>,
            otherwise this operation will be executed twice.
        </note>
    </chapter>

    <chapter title="Execution In A Specific Environment" id="execution_in_a_specific_environment">
        <note>
            By default, the operation will run in all environments.
        </note>

        <p>
            In some cases, it becomes necessary to execute an operation in a specific environment.
            For example <code>production</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            For this you can override the <code>shouldRun</code> method:
        </p>

        <code-block lang="php" src="on_environment.php" include-lines="5-" />

        <p>
            You can also specify multiple environment names:
        </p>

        <code-block lang="php" src="on_environments.php" include-lines="5-" />

        <p>
            You can work with exceptions in the same way:
        </p>

        <code-block lang="php" src="except_environment.php" include-lines="5-" />
    </chapter>

    <chapter title="Database Transactions" id="database_transactions">
        <p>
            In some cases, it becomes necessary to undo previously performed operations in the database.
            For example, when code execution throws an error. To do this, the code must be wrapped in a transaction.
        </p>

        <p>
            By setting the <code>withinTransactions</code> to <code>true</code> parameter,
            you will ensure that your code is wrapped in a transaction without having to manually call the
            <code>DB::transaction()</code> method.
            This will reduce the time it takes to create the operation.
        </p>

        <code-block lang="php" src="within_transactions.php" include-lines="5-" />
    </chapter>

    <chapter title="Asynchronous Call" id="asynchronous_call">
        <p>
            In some cases, it becomes necessary to execute operations in an asynchronous manner without delaying the deployment process.
        </p>

        <p>
            To do this, you need to override the <code>shouldBeAsync</code> method in the operation class:
        </p>

        <code-block lang="php" src="async.php" include-lines="5-" />

        <p>
            In this case, the operation file that defines this parameter will run asynchronously using the
            <code>DragonCode\LaravelDeployOperations\Jobs\OperationJob</code> class.
        </p>

        <p>
            The name of the connection and queue can be changed through the <a href="%config_url%">settings</a>.
        </p>

        <note>
            We remind you that in this case the
            <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/queues">queuing system</a> must work in your application.
